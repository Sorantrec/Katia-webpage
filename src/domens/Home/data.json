And also a language learning geek and a proud owner of two boisterous cats.\n\n\n I transitioned to digital design from English teaching. This background has helped me develop even bigger passion for learning and sharing knowledge as well as given a huge boost to my communicative skills and a few hints on how people think and memorize stuff.\n\n\n If you ask me where I draw my inspiration from, it would be music, travelling and other people."
